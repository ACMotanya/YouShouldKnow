<p>
  The new film – which sees Sandler face off against giant video game characters invading Earth – brought in only $24 million in its first week, continuing a downward trend for the actor/comedian. However, Netflix is reportedly confident that Sandler's status as an "international star" will translate to successful results for The Ridiculous Six, the controversial comedy that will mark the beginning of the collaboration between Sandler and the streaming service.

<h3> Why This Counts </h3>
<p class="main-points">
  The fate of Sandler's career may hang in the balance, with Netflix either giving him a new lease on life or the resounding death knell of his big-screen future.

    <ul>
      <li>
      Sandler has an established fanbase, and last year's Blended nearly doubled its U.S. box office take overseas. It's another smart business move for Netflix.

    <ul>
      <li>
      Critics and audiences seem to be coming to a closer consensus on the actor's work in recent years, with a petition already launched to cancel The Ridiculous Six. Netflix should steer clear.
